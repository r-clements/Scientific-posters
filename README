This repository contains the files for my scientific posters presented at 
the StatSei conference in Santorini, Greece in June of 2011, and a poster
presented at EGU in Vienna, Austria in April of 2012.

Acknowledgements: The baposter.cls and much of the code and comments in the .tex file 
should be credited to Brian Amberg (http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/)
I only edited the code to suit my purposes.

Many thanks go to Alvaro Gonzalez for his efforts on the EGU poster (Mmax).
